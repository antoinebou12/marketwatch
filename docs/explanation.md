It caters to traders of all skill levels and provides various functionalities, such as retrieving game details, portfolio information, executing stock transactions, and accessing leaderboard data. The library is particularly beneficial for users looking to automate their trading strategies or develop trading bots.

In this documentation, we will explain the steps to set up and use the MarketWatch Python library effectively.

## Authentication

To use the MarketWatch Python library, you need to have a MarketWatch account. If you don't already have one, you can sign up for a free account on the MarketWatch website:

https://register.marketwatch.com/register?type=mw-vse

```
from marketwatch import MarketWatch

mw = MarketWatch("email", "password")
```

## Example Usage

With the MarketWatch instance created and authenticated, you can now use the various methods provided by the library. Here's an example of how to retrieve your portfolio information:

```
mw = MarketWatch("email", "password")
portfolio = mw.get_portfolio()
print(portfolio)
```

This code will make a request to the MarketWatch API to retrieve your portfolio information and print it to the console. The `get_portfolio` method returns a dictionary containing information about the stocks you currently hold in your portfolio, such as the stock symbol, the number of shares, and the current value of each stock.
